# Sweap - Music Discovery App ðŸŽµ

A React Native mobile application that helps users discover new music through an intuitive swipe-based interface, similar to Tinder but for songs. Users can swipe right to like songs and left to pass, with the app eventually generating personalized Spotify playlists based on their preferences.

## App Architecture

### Screen Flow
1. **StartupPage**: Animated onboarding with swipe tutorials
2. **LoginPage**: Spotify OAuth authentication
3. **PreferencePage**: Genre and decade selection
4. **MainPage**: Core music discovery interface

### Key Components
- **Navigation Stack**: Native stack navigator managing screen transitions
- **Gesture Handler**: PanGestureHandler for swipe detection and animations
- **Spotify Service**: Centralized API communication and token management
- **Preference System**: Multi-select genre and decade filtering

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Expo CLI
- Spotify Developer Account
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd sweap-music-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Spotify API**
   - Create a Spotify app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Update `SpotifyService.js` with your client ID
   - Configure redirect URIs in your Spotify app settings

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

5. **Run on device/simulator**
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app for physical device testing

## Configuration

### Spotify Integration
Update the `spotifyAuthConfig` in `SpotifyService.js`:

```javascript
const spotifyAuthConfig = {
  clientId: 'your-spotify-client-id',
  scopes: [
    'user-read-private', 
    'user-read-email',
    'user-top-read',
    'user-read-recently-played'
  ],
  // ... other config
};
```

### Genre Mapping
The app includes a genre mapping system to translate UI selections to Spotify's genre seeds:

```javascript
const genreMapping = {
  'POP': 'pop',
  'Rock': 'rock',
  'Hip Hop': 'hip-hop',
  // ... additional mappings
};
```

## Core Functionality

### Music Discovery Algorithm
- Filters songs by selected genres and decades
- Uses Spotify's recommendation engine
- Provides fallback sample data when API is unavailable
- Supports year range filtering for decade-based discovery

### Swipe Mechanics
- **Right Swipe**: Add to liked songs
- **Left Swipe**: Pass on the song
- **Threshold Detection**: Configurable swipe distance for action triggering
- **Visual Feedback**: Card rotation and opacity changes during swipe gestures

### Data Persistence
- Spotify access tokens stored securely
- User preferences maintained across sessions
- Liked/passed song tracking for playlist generation

## Development Notes

### Debug Features
- Development-only debug information display
- Console logging for API interactions and authentication flow
- Redirect URI logging for Spotify app configuration

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when Spotify API is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages for authentication failures
- Network connectivity detection and handling

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Playlist creation and management
- [ ] Social sharing features
- [ ] Music preview playback
